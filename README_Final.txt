# Stock Analysis With VBA

## Overview of Project

Steve approached us to help him with a financial analysis project. He recently graduated college with a 
finance degree, and his parents asked him for help finding green energy companies to invest in. Their
intial focus was on DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ), due to sentimental reasons about its stock ticker being DQ.
Steve planned to look into DQ, but also wanted to diversify their portfolio by looking into other green 
energy stocks as well. Steve is proficient in Excel, but approached us to help him by using VBA programming
to automate the analysis process. 

## Results

We began our analysis by examining the performance of the DQ stock. We intially calculated the total
trading volume of DQ stock in 2018, then expanded our analysis to include the return on investment 
for the year. Unfortunately DQ stock performed very poorly in 2018, with a yearly loss of over 60%. 
Upon finding this we expanded our analysis to include a dozen different green energy stocks, and 
examined their 2018 performance. Finally, we adapted our code to analyze any year in the data that we 
were given, added conditional and static formatting to improve the apprearance and readibility of our data, 
and added a run button for an additional user friendly option.

### Analysis of Green Stocks

While nearly all of the stocks in our analysis produced positive returns in 2017, with four different stocks 
producing returns of over 100%, only two stocks, RUN and ENPH, produced positive returns in 2018. ENPH was 
clearly the best performing stock over the two year sample which we analyzed. ENPH seems like it would be 
the best single stock to invest in, though it seems like a better approach would be a more diversified 
approach given the volatility in the green energy field over the sample we analyzed. 

### Analysis of the Original and Refactored Code

Both the original script and the refactored code yielded the same output for the stock returns in both 2017
and 2018. The refactored code ran the analysis, though, roughly a half second faster per run. The refactored
code seems promising with regards to being able to handle much larger samples of stocks for analysis.

## Summary

One of the advantages of refactoring code is that we can perserve the functionality of the original code, 
while being able make improvements in the design, overall efficiency, and scalability. With this particular
refactored code, we've improved its ability to run larger samples of stock with increased efficiency, which
will allow us to apply it to potentially thousands of stocks at a time. The disadvantages of refactoring 
code is that, if done poorly, we may alter the functionality of the original code, and there's also the risk
of introducing bugs to the code that may be difficult to catch. In the case of this VBA script, we were able
to introduce code that changed the functionality of the original code, altering code that was specific to 
this particular dataset, to code that works in a more general function. This allows us to use it for larger
sets of data across larger timespans, and to also introduce new data as it becomes present.
